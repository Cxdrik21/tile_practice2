This index.html file displays a leaflet map that has custom tiles that are visible at zoom levels 11 and 12. The custom map was delivered using a terrain/recreation themed map from map box with custom colors added to the water and national park areas. The tiles were then generated using Qmetatiles in QGIS and added to a leaflet map.
